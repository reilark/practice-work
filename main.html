    <h1 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h1>
    <p>I am relearning HTML and CSS coding, and hopefully will move on to JavaScript. With that, hopefully, I can do some really fun stuff. Like code a simple game and things of that sort.</p>
    <p>About me, personally, I love my husband, food and horses. Icelandic horses in paticular. They're just so cute! For food, I love seafood, sushi, and steak. And nice thick stews and soups. Especiallly on cold days...</p>
    <p>I play multiple games, one biggie is Minecraft. And, no, ReiLark is not my game name. Sorry :P Yes, I do play horse games, no big surprise there. </p>
    <p>Can you guess my favorite colors?</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Page Info</h1>
    <p>I'm just getting started in really working with coding and such, so, yes, this probably looks like a total newbie's page.
      <span id="underline">Because it is.</span> Improvements will come. CONSTRUCTIVE critism appreciated. Don't be a butt.</p>
    <p>With regards plans for this page, I'm not entirely sure yet. Blog, random writing, I dunno. This is really just a practice page.</p>
    <p>Learning css grid. So far, I prefer the version where you just name the areas instead of specifying actual columns and rows. But, gotta learn both and figure out which is best. But then each can apply to different situations with better or worse results.</p>

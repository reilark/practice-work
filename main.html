        <p>I am relearning HTML and CSS coding, and hopefully will move on to JavaScript. With that, hopefully, I can do some
            really fun stuff. Like code a simple game and things of that sort.</p>
        <p>About me, personally, I love my husband, food and horses. Icelandic horses in paticular. They're just so cute! For
            food, I love seafood, sushi, and steak. And nice thick stews and soups. Especiallly on cold days...</p>
        <p>I play multiple games, one biggie is Minecraft. And, no, ReiLark is not my game name. Sorry :P Yes, I do play horse games, no big surprise there. </p>

        <p>I'm just getting started in really working with coding and such, so, yes, this probably looks like a total newbie's
            page. Because it is. Improvements will come. CONSTRUCTIVE critism appreciated. Don't be a butt.</p>

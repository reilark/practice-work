        <p>I am relearning HTML and CSS coding, and hopefully will move on to JavaScript. With that, hopefully, I can do some
            really fun stuff. Like code a simple game and things of that sort.</p>
        <p>About me, personally, I love my husband, food and horses. Icelandic horses in paticular. They're just so cute! For
            food, I love seafood, sushi, and steak. And nice thick stews and soups. Especiallly on cold days...</p>
        <p>I play multiple games, one biggie is Minecraft. And, no, ReiLark is not my game name. Sorry :P</p>

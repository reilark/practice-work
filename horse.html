        <p>Ever since I was little, I've adored horses. But, I've never been able to own one, or afford riding lessons. But,
            you can always dream, right?</p>
        <p>From having a collection of horse plushies, books, models, full sketchbooks and an imaginary herd, horses were the
            focus in my young life. I remember the first time I went horseback riding on the beach with my family, and my
            horse took off at a canter(gallop? lol, I dunno). It felt like flying.</p>
